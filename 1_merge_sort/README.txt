This is the first in a series of DSA exercises in which I shall attempt to code major data structures & algorithms in Python, then iteratively try out different variations on the DSAs and measure their execution speed to obtain the best possible Python implementations of these DSAs.

The fastest top-down and bottom-up merge sort implementations in this folder are merge_sort_td_v6.py and merge_sort_bu_v3.py, respectively. See for yourself by running performance_test.py.

The tests are largely the same between implementations and are probably not worth looking at more than once. For the second DSA I tackle, I'll find a way to avoid having so many redundant test files lying around.
