I managed to blindly recreate the LeetCode example pretty much exactly. Let's now create a performance test script to compare the two versions (which will be largely copied from my merge sorts' performance_test.py).

My next steps are:
    -create performance test script
    -try out the remaining two combinations while practicing quicksort:
        -blindly rewrite the algorithm with Pythonic swapping and while-loop-based implementation
        -blindly rewrite the algorithm with standard swapping and for-in-range-based implementation

Later, I may also implement an iterative version if I'm feeling adventurous.
