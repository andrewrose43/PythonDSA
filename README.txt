This is a series of DSA exercises in which I shall code major data structures & algorithms in Python, then iteratively try out different variations on the DSAs and measure their execution speed to obtain the best possible Python implementations of these DSAs.

The DSAs are numbered in the order that I completed them. The first one, 1_merge_sort, is rather messy; as I continue through this quest, my DSA implementations and tests should show increasing efficiency, increasing cleanliness, and my deepening familiarity with Python's inner workings.
