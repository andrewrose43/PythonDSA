Notes from comparison to example at https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-program-for-merge-sort/:
-I've wrapped the algorithm in an easily-callable function that doesn't require "lo" and "hi" inputs, unlike the example.
-GfG's copying of data to the temporary arrays is slicker than mine. I'll integrate that into the final product.

For v4:
    -write next version with // instead of int casting, and with merge-in-place but no aux array. Basically, recreate the GeeksForGeeks example blind (and add a wrapper function that obviates the need for l and r parameters).
    -fill temporary lists with list comprehension for succinctness
    -only call len() once for left and once for right when zipper-merging; put it in a temp var
    -integrate GfG's slicker copying syntax for the temporary lists, if I do use temporary lists
